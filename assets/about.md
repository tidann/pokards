## ‚ô† ‚ù§Ô∏è Pokards ‚ô¶ ‚ô£
A mobile/web/desktop app built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) to play the role of the *dealer* in a *Poker Texas hold'em game*.
Made by Timoth√©e Danneels - [See project source on GitHub](https://github.com/tidanneels/pokards)

## Motivation
I am fond of playing Poker, however having to distribute the cards all the time is a long and repetitive task. This is why I imagined *Pokards* to do the job for me :\)

## Tech used
Pokards is written in [Dart](https://dart.dev) with the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) framework.
