## How to use?
To start a game, choose a *Game ID*: it can be any caracter string you want (emojis allowed !), but it is important that every player use the same.
Then, each player choose the *Player* mode and attribute themselves a number that they enter in the *Player number* field.
You can also use another device with the *Table* mode selected, which you can put in the center of the table, just like with real cards.

To see your hand, swipe up from the card at the bottom of the screen. Be sure not to show it to your opponents!
Players bet according to the game's rules, and when it's done, they press *Deal*.

Example :
> Peter, Mary and John all use their phone and choose the Game ID 'poker-game'.
> They select Player mode, Peter chooses the number 1, Mary 2 and John 3.
> They also take a tablet in Table mode.
> Everyone see their cards, they bet (small blind, big blind, etc.) and then they press Deal.
> They repeat the process until the game is finished, and eventually press New game.
